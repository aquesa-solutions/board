# _Cloud Storage Developer Guide_

_API for this storage is as simple as that. No external libraries or complex programs to be implemented. Only thing you have to do is to use the default libraries available in any programming language to send **HTTP-Request** to the backend server developed by us to perform **PLACE-RETRIEVE-AMEND-TRUNCATE (P.R.A.T)** on the data that is being generated by you._

_**Architecture of P.R.A.T**_

_Here, the file, which is present in the client system, is sent to the storage server (either sharded as shown above or sent as it is based on the developer's preference in storing the file). Once done, the cloud storage server sends a response which contains either the successful upload message or any failure + its explanation as response. This is for the place or amend operation. In the case of retrieve or truncate operations, nothing extra is to be sent as payload from the client in the http request. Just the operation name + filename and boom, the file is either sent to you (retrieve operation) or the full-file/individual shards associated with the filename provided in the http request are removed from the storage space (truncate operation)._

Below sample code gives you an idea

```python
import requests

headers = {
  "Origin": "https://<api_key>.storage-api.cloud.aquesa-solutions.com"
}

url1 = 'https://<api_key>.storage-api.cloud.aquesa-solutions.com/p'
url2 = 'https://<api_key>.storage-api.cloud.aquesa-solutions.com/r'
url3 = 'https://<api_key>.storage-api.cloud.aquesa-solutions.com/t'

res = requests.post(url1, data={"file_name": "test.txt"}, files={"file": "Hello,world!"})
print(res.text)

res = requests.post(url2, json={"file_name": file_})
print(res.text)

res = requests.post(url3, json={"file_name": file_})
print(res.text)
```

_**URL format**_:
<pre>
https://&ltkey&gt.storage-api.cloud.aquesa-solutions.com/&ltop&gt
  <b>&ltkey&gt</b>: The key assigned to you during your initial registration.
  <b>&ltop&gt</b>: The operation being performed.
    <b>p</b>: PLACE | AMEND
    <b>r</b>: RETRIEVE
    <b>t</b>: TRUNCATE
</pre>

_**Payload keys and request types for the operations**_:
<pre>
  <b>PLACE (POST)</b>
    file_name (Ex: requests -> data={"file_name":"test.txt"})
    file (Ex: requests file={"file":"contents"})

  <b>RETRIEVE (GET) (or) TRUNCATE (POST)</b>:
    file_name (Ex: requests -> json={"file_name":"test.txt"})
</pre>

We have designed the architecture and server in such a way that the developers can write their own scripts to have a complete control over the program they are developing without the hassle of learning/debugging/integrating third party sdk's or libraries or tools or related.
